## What is Digital Forensics and how is it used today?
Digital forensics is the mere digitisation of the traditional use and applications of forensic investigation, for example, within police departments after a crime has been committed.

Artefacts such as blood, fingerprints or hair fibres are used in criminal investigations to paint a picture of the events that took place and who was involved. Digital forensics is the same collection of artefacts, however, these artefacts being events on a digital device.

Images are bit-for-bit replications of devices, aptly titled "images" giving a nod to photography. These images can derive from anything such as a SatNavs for a car, a smart TV, to a router and a full-on server.

As you'll come to discover, digital devices hold plethoras of information, and in turn, evidence about our activities. In this room we'll be analysing an iOS device.
